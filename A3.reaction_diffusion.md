# Assignment 3 - Reaction Diffusion (simulation #1)

OK, let's make a simulation run on the GPU that would be *extremely* slow running on the CPU. We'll go with Reaction Diffusion, because:

1. It can look rather spectacular!
2. The setup is basically the same as what we've done in class for the 2D automata.

## Resources
• Here’s the primary reference we’ll use for the RD equation:
Karl Sims tutorial on reaction-diffusion:  [https://karlsims.com/rd.html](https://karlsims.com/rd.html) 

• This is a fantastic video tutorial that covers RD. Although rendngrig done on the CPU using p5.js (hah! look how slow it runs!) the instructor
does a great job explaining the RD equation:

• Alan Turing’s classic paper on the subject:
The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis:  [http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf) 

• One cool example of RD in action:

• Another great example of morphogenesis for inspiration (although this is not reaction diffusion) by Andy Lomas: [https://vimeo.com/105417695](https://vimeo.com/105417695)  

## Requirements
- Create an interactive piece that runs in a HTML page hosted at site of your choosing (GitHub Pages is fine for this). 
You may use either the vanilla WebGL or regl + Parcel for this project. The piece should feature a fullscreen fragment
shader with the following features:
  - Implement the Reaction Diffusion algorithm running on the GPU
  - Implement controls for the various coefficients of RD (feed, kill, diffusion A, diffusion B). You can use [TweakPane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/) for this or any other control system as
  long as the controls are clear how they should be used.
  - Implement at least one of the "options" Sims describes (orientation, style map, flow, size). Note that choosing style map or flow will require you to think 
  about how your option combines with user interactions controlling feed / diffusion.

- Write one paragraph (~200 words) that describe what you created (which option you explored, what controls you made, any interesting aesthetic decisions).

- Create a repo with all code for the project. Make sure your `package.json` file lists all dependencies correctly and your README contains instructions to build
the project (if needed). Once you have your code uploaded to a repo, try cloning it to see if the proejct runs as intended.

- No video documentation is required for this assignemnt. Update your personal site for the class with a link to the running project, a link to your technical / aesthetic explanation (this could be in the REaDME for your project repo), and a link to your repo.

To be clear, if you're personal website is a simple github repo, after this your primary README should look something like the following:

- Assignment #1: [video](http://wpi.edu), [code](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #2: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Mini-assignment #1 (video feedback): [link](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #3: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)

... but with correct links. 

Grading Rubric
---
- 10% Project/repository/explanation is posted to your personal course website correctly
- 30% Basic reaction diffusion equation is implemented
- 20% A "option" for reaction diffusion is implemented
- 10% Interaction controls are provided
- 20% Two summary paragraphs. One should concisely explain what you did technically (What option did you explore? What controls did you make?) and a 
final paragraph describing feedback received and how it met or didn't meet your expectations
- 10% free points for dealing with the past two years

This assignment will count for 10–12.5% of your final grade, depending on whether we do four or five assignments in the course. Please take time to ensure that spelling / grammar are correct and that the assignment is linked / posted / hostted correctly so that you don't lose any easy points.
