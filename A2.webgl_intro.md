# Assignment 2 - WebGL Intro

The goal of this assignment is to move away from all the niceness that The Force provides and get everyone comfortable
using HTML/JavaScript in conjunction with shaders before we begin doing our simulation work.

- Create an interactive piece that runs in a HTML page hosted at site of your choosing (GitHub Pages is fine for this). You may use either the vanilla WebGL template or the regl + parcel template for this project. The piece should feature a fullscreen fragment
shader with the following features:
  - The piece should incorporate live video in some way (see the [video texture example](https://github.com/imgd-cs-420x-2022/imgd-cs-420x-2022.github.io/blob/main/video_to_texture.html) from the course repo)
  - The piece should incorporate some type of noise (simplex noise, fractal brownian motion etc). Please make sure to read the assigned chapters from the Book of Shaders this week before beginning the project.
  - The piece should feature at least four different interaction mechanisms. This might include using the mouse / touch, regular HTML form elements, or widgets 
    from a library like [TweakPane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/) 

- Write two paragraphs (150–200 words) that describe your aesthetic intent and what you were interested in exploring technically.

- Send a link to a classmate for feedback (this can be coordinated via Discord). Write a paragraph that describes the feedback of your classmate and whether or not it matched your expectations... and of course it's totally fine if it doesn't match them (and possibly much more interesting!). 
  Be sure to note if a feature in your project doesn't work for the classmate (for example, video capture) but does work for you. Feel free to include feedback from addition classmates / other people if you like, but only one source of feedback is required.

- Create a repo with all code for the project. Make sure your `package.json` file lists all dependencies correctly and your README contains instructions to build
the project (if needed). Once you have your code uploaded to a repo, try cloning it to see if the proejct runs as intended.

- No video documentation is required for this assignemnt. Update your personal site for the class with a link to the running project, a link to your technical / aesthetic explanation (this could be in the REaDME for your project repo), and a link to your repo.

To be clear, if you're personal website is a simple github repo, after this your primary README should look something like the following:

- Assignment #1: [video](http://wpi.edu), [code](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #2: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)

... but with correct links. 

Grading Rubric
---
- 10% Project/repository/explanation is posted to your personal course website correctly
- 10% Video capture is incorporated into the project
- 10% Noise is incorporated into the project
- 40% At least four different interaction mechanisms are provided (10% each)
- 5% Visual Aesthetics. Is there a discernible theme in the work? What constraints are in place (limited color-palette, limited number of shapes etc.)? 
- 10% Two summary paragraphs. One should concisely explain what you did technically (What functions did you use? Did you combine any in interesting ways?) and the other should describe your aesthetic goals. Justify your aesthetic decisions to us!
- 10% A final paragraph describing feedback received and how it met or didn't meet your expectations
- 5%  free points for dealing with the past two years

This assignment will count for 10–12.5% of your final grade, depending on whether we do four or five assignments in the course. Please take time to ensure that spelling / grammar are correct and that the assignment is linked / posted / hostted correctly so that you don't lose any easy points.
