# Assignment 4 - Physarum (simulation #2)

Now that we've built physarum, let's have some fun with it. Unlike reaction diffusion, there are a *ton* of parameters we can play with to change the look and feel of the 
simulation. Check out the resources listed at the top of the day 9 notes, but here are some ideas:

1. Sensor distance - this is easily changed in the simulation vertex shader and can create pretty significant differences in the output.
2. Chemical desposit - this is controlled by adjusting the output of the simulation fragment shader.
3. Diffusion kernel
4. Decay amount
5. Agent rotation amount
6. Initial starting positions of agents
7. Introducing "obstacles" for slime molds to travel around
8. Using time to "sweep" sensors back and forth
9. Using time to change agent rotation
10. The size of each agent (gl_PointSize in simulation vertex shader)
11. etc. etc. explore and find more of your own!

## Requirements
- Create an interactive piece that runs in a HTML page hosted at site of your choosing (GitHub Pages is fine for this). 
You may use either the vanilla WebGL or regl + Parcel for this project. The piece should feature a fullscreen fragment
shader with the following features:
  - Implement the Physarum algorithm running on the GPU
  - Implement controls for at least five aspects of the simulation of your choice. I strongly recommend using [TweakPane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/) for this or any other control system as
  long as the controls are clear how they should be used.
  - Create buttons to change beween at least 4 different "presets" that you found interesting

- Write four short paragraphs (100–200 words) that describe each preset and what you found interesting about it. 

- Create a repo with all code for the project. Make sure your `package.json` file lists all dependencies correctly and your README contains instructions to build
the project (if needed). Once you have your code uploaded to a repo, try cloning it to see if the project runs as intended.

- Update your personal site for the class with a link to the running project, a link to your technical / aesthetic explanation (this could be in the README for your project repo), and a link to your repo.

To be clear, if you're personal website is a simple github repo, after this your primary README should look something like the following:

- Assignment #1: [video](http://wpi.edu), [code](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #2: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Mini-assignment #1 (video feedback): [link](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #3: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)
- Assignment #4: [project](http://wpi.edu), [repo](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)

... but with correct links. 

Grading Rubric
---
- 10% Project/repository/explanation is posted to your personal course website correctly
- 30% Basic Physarum algorithm is implemented
- 20% Four presets are present, with reasonably significant differences between each of them
- 20% Interaction controls are provided
- 20% Four summary paragraphs describing your presets

This assignment will count for 10–12.5% of your final grade, depending on whether we do four or five assignments in the course. Please take time to ensure that spelling / grammar are correct and that the assignment is linked / posted / hostted correctly so that you don't lose any easy points.
