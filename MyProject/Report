  My asthetic intent on this project was to display a gradient and see how it interacts. I chose the colors red, purple, and blue as my gradient pallete. The initial animation started reddish, purple and blue is introduced afterwords. I wanted to show a conflict between the red and blue for screentime.. For music, I chose Tchaikovsky: Swan Lake, Op. 20, Act II: No. 10, Scene. Moderato. The song’s chorus emphasizes conflict. I chose ballet music because I’m currently in orchestral mood. Overall, the animation should not have been too harsh on the eyes because I get sick easily from the flashing lights.
	My technical intent on this project was to explore waves, in particular sine and cosine. I experimented with rotate and time with three different waves. With the voronoi, I have it rotating while shifting larger and smaller as a background. As time progresses, the four vectors resonate with a soft breathe like motion.
	After being review by Evelyn, I totally agree with her on the fact that my animation is towards the soft side for the eyes. I agree with her on the fact that it looks like Aurora Borealis. I unfortunately missed the mark on getting the pronounce conflict between red and blue for screentime. I think if I were to remake this animation, I’d have harsher transitions when the chorus hits.
